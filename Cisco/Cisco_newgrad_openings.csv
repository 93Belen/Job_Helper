We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.          &#160;                                                  So, you have colorful hair?

We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.          &#160;                                                  So, you have colorful hair?

But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)                                                          Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.                                                          So, you have colorful hair? Don&#8217;t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That&#8217;s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects.

But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)                                                          Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.                                                          So, you have colorful hair?

Some may think             we&#8217;re             &#8220;old&#8221; (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but             we&#8217;re             also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts,             learns             and protects. No other company can do what we do &#8211; you             can&#8217;t             put us in a box!                    &#160;                                      But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)          &#160;                                      Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.          &#160;                                                  So, you have colorful hair?

From 12 months out to 5 years in the future, wearing multiple hats, failing and learning fast, challenging assumptions and finding new ways of solving problems. Driving form from ambiguity. It&#8217;s about creativity. We are looking for entrepreneurs, Problem solvers, Designers &amp; Marketers. Product Led Growth experts. Business Development, SDRs, Customer Success. Product Managers, SWEs, SREs. Data Scientists and ML engineers.  Yes, we are building the next set of startups with the support of a trusted name like Cisco. Where else will you get to do this?

WHY CISCO    #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here's how we do it.  We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&#8217;re &#8220;old&#8221; (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we&#8217;re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do &#8211; you can&#8217;t put us in a box!  But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)  Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

These days we are looking to make those ASICs more general and programmable. Cisco Common ASIC Group is looking for a ASIC Verification Engineer to drive existing projects and engage in new development of our next generation switching systems.              As part of the ASIC team, you will be developing the ASICs at the heart of each of these switch products. There are only a very few teams worldwide that implement such devices. Every time you access the Internet, chances are, your data's been through one of our switches.

Who You Are                    You are a talented, motivated ASIC verification engineer to join the team and contribute to the verification of very complex ASICs. You will have a Design Verification background, hands-on experience in System Verilog and UVM methodology, with in-depth knowledge of C++, scripting, as well as ASIC design and verification flow.              You&#8217;ll be part of Cisco Common ASIC Group, focusing on developing and upgrading various test benches and contributing to different aspects of verification infrastructure.              You will collaborate closely with the design team and the hardware team to verify the ASIC in simulation, in emulation and during ASIC bring up.

Ability to debug issues independently                    Knowledge of UVM based verification methodology is a plus                    Basic scripting experience (Python, Perl, shell programming)                    Nice to have C, C++ programming and debugging skills                    Good written and verbal communication skills                    Collaborative and team-focused, with the drive to learn and grow                            We Are Cisco                    #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.              We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&#8217;re &#8220;old&#8221; (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we&#8217;re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns, and protects. No other company can do what we do &#8211; you can&#8217;t put us in a box!              But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)              Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.              So, you have colorful hair? Don&#8217;t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That&#8217;s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing?

Some may think             we&#8217;re             &#8220;old&#8221; (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but             we&#8217;re             also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts,             learns             and protects. No other company can do what we do &#8211; you             can&#8217;t             put us in a box!                    &#160;                                      But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)          &#160;                                      Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.          &#160;                                                  So, you have colorful hair?

We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects.

We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.                                                          So, you have colorful hair?

Some may think             we&#8217;re             &#8220;old&#8221; (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but             we&#8217;re             also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts,             learns             and protects. No other company can do what we do &#8211; you             can&#8217;t             put us in a box!                    &#160;                                      But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)          &#160;                                      Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.          &#160;                                                  So, you have colorful hair?

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&#8217;re &#8220;old&#8221; (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we&#8217;re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do &#8211; you can&#8217;t put us in a box!                                                          But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)                                                          Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.                                                          So, you have colorful hair?

WHY CISCO    #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here's how we do it.  We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&#8217;re &#8220;old&#8221; (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we&#8217;re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do &#8211; you can&#8217;t put us in a box!  But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)  Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.  So, you have colorful hair? Don&#8217;t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That&#8217;s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!          #WEARECISCO                                                                                          Graduate Cloud Native Platform Engineer                        &#160;                                                                                                                                                                                  What You'll Do                        &#160;                                                                          As a Cloud Engineer within the Webex Cloud Native Platform organization, you will work with teams that build robust, highly available and stable platform services to host 100s of backend services.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&#8217;re &#8220;old&#8221; (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we&#8217;re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do &#8211; you can&#8217;t put us in a box!   But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)   Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.   So, you have colorful hair?

From 12 months out to 5 years in the future, wearing multiple hats, failing and learning fast, challenging assumptions and finding new ways of solving problems. Driving form from ambiguity. It&#8217;s about creativity. We are looking for entrepreneurs, Problem solvers, Designers &amp; Marketers. Product Led Growth experts. Business Development, SDRs, Customer Success. Product Managers, SWEs, SREs. Data Scientists and ML engineers.  Yes, we are building the next set of startups with the support of a trusted name like Cisco. Where else will you get to do this? We are Cisco ET&amp;I. We run bold, we run agile, and we run ambitious. Come create with us.  &#160;  Learn more about us at https://eti.cisco.com.              WHAT YOU'LL DO    - Perform research to identify potential attack steps in different public cloud services  - Research and suggest new threat detection capabilities  - Design, prototype, document findings  - Work closely and accompany relevant teams (R&amp;D, Machine Learning) in developing new detectors/features  - Work together with the different engineering team to develop the code to support the research findings.  - Collaborate with multiple product teams to design sensors, implement detection ideas, and validate their effectiveness using a data-driven approach.

WHY CISCO    #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here's how we do it.  We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&#8217;re &#8220;old&#8221; (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we&#8217;re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do &#8211; you can&#8217;t put us in a box!  But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)  Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

You will have a Design Verification background, hands-on experience in System Verilog and UVM methodology, with in-depth knowledge of C++, scripting, as well as ASIC design and verification flow.              You&#8217;ll be part of Cisco Common ASIC Group, focusing on developing and upgrading various test benches and contributing to different aspects of verification infrastructure.              You will collaborate closely with the design team and the hardware team to verify the ASIC in simulation, in emulation and during ASIC bring up.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&#8217;re &#8220;old&#8221; (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we&#8217;re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns, and protects. No other company can do what we do &#8211; you can&#8217;t put us in a box!              But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)              Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.              So, you have colorful hair? Don&#8217;t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That&#8217;s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing?

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&#8217;re &#8220;old&#8221; (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we&#8217;re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do &#8211; you can&#8217;t put us in a box!   But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)   Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.   So, you have colorful hair?

Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.          &#160;                                                  So, you have colorful hair?

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&#8217;re &#8220;old&#8221; (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we&#8217;re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do &#8211; you can&#8217;t put us in a box!   But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)   Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.   So, you have colorful hair?

Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.          &#160;                                                  So, you have colorful hair?

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&#8217;re &#8220;old&#8221; (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we&#8217;re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do &#8211; you can&#8217;t put us in a box!   But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)   Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.   So, you have colorful hair?

We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects.

But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)                                                          Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.                                                          So, you have colorful hair?

We are chartered to build the next new business for Cisco. To take Cisco into new markets, and especially towards new personas -  both buyer and user. And like building a startup from the ground up, it&#8217;s all about having an entrepreneurial approach. Taking an idea from an astonishing thought to a product that solves a critical need, to an experience that delights users and customers.  It&#8217;s about innovation. From 12 months out to 5 years in the future, wearing multiple hats, failing and learning fast, challenging assumptions and finding new ways of solving problems. Driving form from ambiguity. It&#8217;s about creativity. We are looking for entrepreneurs, Problem solvers, Designers &amp; Marketers. Product Led Growth experts. Business Development, SDRs, Customer Success. Product Managers, SWEs, SREs. Data Scientists and ML engineers.  Yes, we are building the next set of startups with the support of a trusted name like Cisco. Where else will you get to do this? We are Cisco ET&amp;I. We run bold, we run agile, and we run ambitious. Come create with us.  &#160;  Learn more about us at https://eti.cisco.com.

WHY CISCO    #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here's how we do it.  We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&#8217;re &#8220;old&#8221; (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we&#8217;re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do &#8211; you can&#8217;t put us in a box!  But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)  Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

These days we are looking to make those ASICs more general and programmable. Cisco Common ASIC Group is looking for a ASIC Verification Engineer to drive existing projects and engage in new development of our next generation switching systems.              As part of the ASIC team, you will be developing the ASICs at the heart of each of these switch products. There are only a very few teams worldwide that implement such devices. Every time you access the Internet, chances are, your data's been through one of our switches.

You will have a Design Verification background, hands-on experience in System Verilog and UVM methodology, with in-depth knowledge of C++, scripting, as well as ASIC design and verification flow.              You&#8217;ll be part of Cisco Common ASIC Group, focusing on developing and upgrading various test benches and contributing to different aspects of verification infrastructure.              You will collaborate closely with the design team and the hardware team to verify the ASIC in simulation, in emulation and during ASIC bring up.                                                                    Responsibilities Include:                            Maintaining existing UVM test benches for block level verification                    Upgrading test benches to accommodate new features                    Developing sequences and tests in UVM as per the testplan                    Upgrading/updating configuration/reset sequences (APIs)                    Writing tests, and debugging regressions                    Be a part of emulation testing efforts                                                                                    Education and Experience Required:                            University Graduate with Bachelor&#8217;s degree in EE (Electrical &amp; Electronics) or CE (Computer Engineering)                    Relevant experience with System Verilog based verification                            Knowledge and Skills:                            Basic understanding of System Verilog                    Ability to understand hardware design specification document for a block or feature and capture the necessary tests to verify it full.                    Ability to debug issues independently                    Knowledge of UVM based verification methodology is a plus                    Basic scripting experience (Python, Perl, shell programming)                    Nice to have C, C++ programming and debugging skills                    Good written and verbal communication skills                    Collaborative and team-focused, with the drive to learn and grow                            We Are Cisco                    #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.              We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&#8217;re &#8220;old&#8221; (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we&#8217;re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns, and protects. No other company can do what we do &#8211; you can&#8217;t put us in a box!              But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)              Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.              So, you have colorful hair? Don&#8217;t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That&#8217;s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing?

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&#8217;re &#8220;old&#8221; (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we&#8217;re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do &#8211; you can&#8217;t put us in a box!   But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)   Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.   So, you have colorful hair?

From 12 months out to 5 years in the future, wearing multiple hats, failing and learning fast, challenging assumptions and finding new ways of solving problems. Driving form from ambiguity. It&#8217;s about creativity. We are looking for entrepreneurs, Problem solvers, Designers &amp; Marketers. Product Led Growth experts. Business Development, SDRs, Customer Success. Product Managers, SWEs, SREs. Data Scientists and ML engineers.  Yes, we are building the next set of startups with the support of a trusted name like Cisco. Where else will you get to do this? We are Cisco ET&amp;I. We run bold, we run agile, and we run ambitious. Come create with us.  &#160;  Learn more about us at https://eti.cisco.com.              WHAT YOU'LL DO    - Perform research to identify potential attack steps in different public cloud services  - Research and suggest new threat detection capabilities  - Design, prototype, document findings  - Work closely and accompany relevant teams (R&amp;D, Machine Learning) in developing new detectors/features  - Work together with the different engineering team to develop the code to support the research findings.  - Collaborate with multiple product teams to design sensors, implement detection ideas, and validate their effectiveness using a data-driven approach.

WHY CISCO    #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here's how we do it.  We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&#8217;re &#8220;old&#8221; (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we&#8217;re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do &#8211; you can&#8217;t put us in a box!  But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)  Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

You will have a Design Verification background, hands-on experience in System Verilog and UVM methodology, with in-depth knowledge of C++, scripting, as well as ASIC design and verification flow.              You&#8217;ll be part of Cisco Common ASIC Group, focusing on developing and upgrading various test benches and contributing to different aspects of verification infrastructure.              You will collaborate closely with the design team and the hardware team to verify the ASIC in simulation, in emulation and during ASIC bring up.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&#8217;re &#8220;old&#8221; (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we&#8217;re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns, and protects. No other company can do what we do &#8211; you can&#8217;t put us in a box!              But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)              Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.              So, you have colorful hair? Don&#8217;t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That&#8217;s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing?

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&#8217;re &#8220;old&#8221; (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we&#8217;re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do &#8211; you can&#8217;t put us in a box!   But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)   Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.   So, you have colorful hair?

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&#8217;re &#8220;old&#8221; (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we&#8217;re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do &#8211; you can&#8217;t put us in a box!                                                          But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)                                                          Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.                                                          So, you have colorful hair?

We are chartered to build the next new business for Cisco. To take Cisco into new markets, and especially towards new personas -  both buyer and user. And like building a startup from the ground up, it&#8217;s all about having an entrepreneurial approach. Taking an idea from an astonishing thought to a product that solves a critical need, to an experience that delights users and customers.  It&#8217;s about innovation. From 12 months out to 5 years in the future, wearing multiple hats, failing and learning fast, challenging assumptions and finding new ways of solving problems. Driving form from ambiguity. It&#8217;s about creativity. We are looking for entrepreneurs, Problem solvers, Designers &amp; Marketers. Product Led Growth experts. Business Development, SDRs, Customer Success. Product Managers, SWEs, SREs. Data Scientists and ML engineers.  Yes, we are building the next set of startups with the support of a trusted name like Cisco. Where else will you get to do this? We are Cisco ET&amp;I. We run bold, we run agile, and we run ambitious. Come create with us.  &#160;  Learn more about us at https://eti.cisco.com.

WHY CISCO    #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here's how we do it.  We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&#8217;re &#8220;old&#8221; (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we&#8217;re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do &#8211; you can&#8217;t put us in a box!  But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)  Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&#8217;re &#8220;old&#8221; (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we&#8217;re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do &#8211; you can&#8217;t put us in a box!   But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)   Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.   So, you have colorful hair?

We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects.

But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)                                                          Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.                                                          So, you have colorful hair?

We are chartered to build the next new business for Cisco. To take Cisco into new markets, and especially towards new personas -  both buyer and user. And like building a startup from the ground up, it&#8217;s all about having an entrepreneurial approach. Taking an idea from an astonishing thought to a product that solves a critical need, to an experience that delights users and customers.  It&#8217;s about innovation. From 12 months out to 5 years in the future, wearing multiple hats, failing and learning fast, challenging assumptions and finding new ways of solving problems. Driving form from ambiguity. It&#8217;s about creativity. We are looking for entrepreneurs, Problem solvers, Designers &amp; Marketers. Product Led Growth experts. Business Development, SDRs, Customer Success. Product Managers, SWEs, SREs. Data Scientists and ML engineers.  Yes, we are building the next set of startups with the support of a trusted name like Cisco. Where else will you get to do this? We are Cisco ET&amp;I. We run bold, we run agile, and we run ambitious. Come create with us.  &#160;  Learn more about us at https://eti.cisco.com.

WHY CISCO    #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here's how we do it.  We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&#8217;re &#8220;old&#8221; (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we&#8217;re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do &#8211; you can&#8217;t put us in a box!  But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)  Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

These days we are looking to make those ASICs more general and programmable. Cisco Common ASIC Group is looking for a ASIC Verification Engineer to drive existing projects and engage in new development of our next generation switching systems.              As part of the ASIC team, you will be developing the ASICs at the heart of each of these switch products. There are only a very few teams worldwide that implement such devices. Every time you access the Internet, chances are, your data's been through one of our switches.

You will have a Design Verification background, hands-on experience in System Verilog and UVM methodology, with in-depth knowledge of C++, scripting, as well as ASIC design and verification flow.              You&#8217;ll be part of Cisco Common ASIC Group, focusing on developing and upgrading various test benches and contributing to different aspects of verification infrastructure.              You will collaborate closely with the design team and the hardware team to verify the ASIC in simulation, in emulation and during ASIC bring up.                                                                    Responsibilities Include:                            Maintaining existing UVM test benches for block level verification                    Upgrading test benches to accommodate new features                    Developing sequences and tests in UVM as per the testplan                    Upgrading/updating configuration/reset sequences (APIs)                    Writing tests, and debugging regressions                    Be a part of emulation testing efforts                                                                                    Education and Experience Required:                            University Graduate with Bachelor&#8217;s degree in EE (Electrical &amp; Electronics) or CE (Computer Engineering)                    Relevant experience with System Verilog based verification                            Knowledge and Skills:                            Basic understanding of System Verilog                    Ability to understand hardware design specification document for a block or feature and capture the necessary tests to verify it full.                    Ability to debug issues independently                    Knowledge of UVM based verification methodology is a plus                    Basic scripting experience (Python, Perl, shell programming)                    Nice to have C, C++ programming and debugging skills                    Good written and verbal communication skills                    Collaborative and team-focused, with the drive to learn and grow                            We Are Cisco                    #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.              We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&#8217;re &#8220;old&#8221; (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we&#8217;re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns, and protects. No other company can do what we do &#8211; you can&#8217;t put us in a box!              But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)              Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.              So, you have colorful hair? Don&#8217;t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That&#8217;s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing?

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&#8217;re &#8220;old&#8221; (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we&#8217;re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do &#8211; you can&#8217;t put us in a box!   But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)   Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.   So, you have colorful hair?

Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.          &#160;                                                  So, you have colorful hair?

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&#8217;re &#8220;old&#8221; (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we&#8217;re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do &#8211; you can&#8217;t put us in a box!   But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)   Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.   So, you have colorful hair?

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&#8217;re &#8220;old&#8221; (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we&#8217;re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects.

But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)                                                          Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.                                                          So, you have colorful hair?

We are chartered to build the next new business for Cisco. To take Cisco into new markets, and especially towards new personas -  both buyer and user. And like building a startup from the ground up, it&#8217;s all about having an entrepreneurial approach. Taking an idea from an astonishing thought to a product that solves a critical need, to an experience that delights users and customers.  It&#8217;s about innovation. From 12 months out to 5 years in the future, wearing multiple hats, failing and learning fast, challenging assumptions and finding new ways of solving problems. Driving form from ambiguity. It&#8217;s about creativity. We are looking for entrepreneurs, Problem solvers, Designers &amp; Marketers. Product Led Growth experts. Business Development, SDRs, Customer Success. Product Managers, SWEs, SREs. Data Scientists and ML engineers.  Yes, we are building the next set of startups with the support of a trusted name like Cisco. Where else will you get to do this? We are Cisco ET&amp;I. We run bold, we run agile, and we run ambitious. Come create with us.  &#160;  Learn more about us at https://eti.cisco.com.

WHY CISCO    #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here's how we do it.  We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&#8217;re &#8220;old&#8221; (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we&#8217;re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do &#8211; you can&#8217;t put us in a box!  But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)  Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

These days we are looking to make those ASICs more general and programmable. Cisco Common ASIC Group is looking for a ASIC Verification Engineer to drive existing projects and engage in new development of our next generation switching systems.              As part of the ASIC team, you will be developing the ASICs at the heart of each of these switch products. There are only a very few teams worldwide that implement such devices. Every time you access the Internet, chances are, your data's been through one of our switches.

You will have a Design Verification background, hands-on experience in System Verilog and UVM methodology, with in-depth knowledge of C++, scripting, as well as ASIC design and verification flow.              You&#8217;ll be part of Cisco Common ASIC Group, focusing on developing and upgrading various test benches and contributing to different aspects of verification infrastructure.              You will collaborate closely with the design team and the hardware team to verify the ASIC in simulation, in emulation and during ASIC bring up.                                                                    Responsibilities Include:                            Maintaining existing UVM test benches for block level verification                    Upgrading test benches to accommodate new features                    Developing sequences and tests in UVM as per the testplan                    Upgrading/updating configuration/reset sequences (APIs)                    Writing tests, and debugging regressions                    Be a part of emulation testing efforts                                                                                    Education and Experience Required:                            University Graduate with Bachelor&#8217;s degree in EE (Electrical &amp; Electronics) or CE (Computer Engineering)                    Relevant experience with System Verilog based verification                            Knowledge and Skills:                            Basic understanding of System Verilog                    Ability to understand hardware design specification document for a block or feature and capture the necessary tests to verify it full.                    Ability to debug issues independently                    Knowledge of UVM based verification methodology is a plus                    Basic scripting experience (Python, Perl, shell programming)                    Nice to have C, C++ programming and debugging skills                    Good written and verbal communication skills                    Collaborative and team-focused, with the drive to learn and grow                            We Are Cisco                    #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.              We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&#8217;re &#8220;old&#8221; (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we&#8217;re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns, and protects. No other company can do what we do &#8211; you can&#8217;t put us in a box!              But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)              Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.              So, you have colorful hair? Don&#8217;t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That&#8217;s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing?

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&#8217;re &#8220;old&#8221; (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we&#8217;re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do &#8211; you can&#8217;t put us in a box!   But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)   Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.   So, you have colorful hair?
