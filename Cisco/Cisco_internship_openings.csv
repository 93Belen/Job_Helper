Start date: April-June 2023  Duration: 6 months  Location: Hybrid, Paris office &amp; home office                        TEAM OVERVIEW            The intern will be part of the Cloud Native Data Plane (CNDP) team within the Security Business Group (SBG) at Cisco. This team contributes to many projects across SBG by developing, maintaining, and customizing the Vector Packet Processor (VPP), which is an open source piece of software part of the fd.io project. VPP is recognized as the most performant software-based packet forwarder available. This makes the CNDP team the ideal place to learn about high-performance data-plane programming.                       TOPIC OVERVIEW                       The Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) initiative consists of providing end-users with a combination of Software Defined WAN (SD-WAN) services and Network security services, all running in the cloud. In this context, SASE-providers must terminate a very large number of tunnels of various types (e.g., IPsec) in their own infrastructure. Unless the infrastructure is heavily overprovisioned with regards to the aggregated throughput of all the tunnels, Input/Output (I/O) and Central Processing Unit (CPU) resource contention is inevitable at the ingress of this infrastructure. Such contention might lead to unfairness, and poor per-customer latency and throughput guarantees, thus the SASE provider&#8217;s inability to honor any kind of network Service Level Objectives.   As a result, it is necessary to design some traffic policing scheme at the ingress of the system (i.e., at the tunnel termination point), that would perform traffic scheduling (i.e., delaying packets belonging to a flow to reduce its burstiness and impact on the downstream system&#8217;s buffers) and/or selective packet dropping, to ensure fairness among all tunnels.   While there are plenty of theoretical algorithms that ensure a high level of fairness between flows (for various definitions of fairness), those very often suffer from scalability issues due to the necessity of tracking the state of the different flows traversing the system. Moreover, even for algorithms whose scalability have been studied from a purely &#8220;computer-science&#8221; perspective (usually meaning asymptotic complexity for a large number of flows), such an approach is insufficient at the levels of throughput targeted by a high-performance software data plane.   In fact, properties such as cache-friendliness, or code vectorizability are more important when the per-packet CPU-budget for traffic policing is in the order of a hundred cycles. To the best of our knowledge, very little research has been done with this perspective in mind                      INTERNSHIP GOALS             This internship main general goal is to study traffic policing algorithms from the aforementioned perspective, in the context of SASE ingress. This can be carried out by means of:   &#8226;	A review of state-of-the-art traffic policing algorithms that ensure reasonable levels of fairness at a minimal complexity   &#8226;	Select among this list, those which have properties compatible with a high-performance packet-forwarding engine (review data structure cache locality for example)   &#8226;	Propose efficient implementations in a software dataplane (either the Linux Kernel, Click, or VPP)   &#8226;	Propose a quantitative theoretical and experimental analysis of those algorithms going beyond traditional asymptotical analysis   &#8226;	Release produced code in open source and theoretical and experimental results as an academical publication                       EXPECTED SKILLS                      C programming   Good understanding of core principles of packet switched networks and queuing networks   Ability to jump into a complex code base and hack into it   Ability to read and understand computer science/computer networking research papers   Academic English reading/writing skills         "

We&#8217;re confronting the status quo with the power of diversity, inclusion, and teamwork.

We&#8217;re building an employee experience that includes appreciation, belonging, growth, and purpose for everyone.              Start date: April-June 2023  Duration: 6 months  Location: Hybrid, Paris office &amp; home office                        TEAM OVERVIEW            The intern will be part of the Cloud Native Data Plane (CNDP) team within the Security Business Group (SBG) at Cisco. This team contributes to many projects across SBG by developing, maintaining, and customizing the Vector Packet Processor (VPP), which is an open source piece of software part of the fd.io project. VPP is recognized as the most performant software-based packet forwarder available. This makes the CNDP team the ideal place to learn about high-performance data-plane programming.                       TOPIC OVERVIEW                       The Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) initiative consists of providing end-users with a combination of Software Defined WAN (SD-WAN) services and Network security services, all running in the cloud. In this context, SASE-providers must terminate a very large number of tunnels of various types (e.g., IPsec) in their own infrastructure. Unless the infrastructure is heavily overprovisioned with regards to the aggregated throughput of all the tunnels, Input/Output (I/O) and Central Processing Unit (CPU) resource contention is inevitable at the ingress of this infrastructure. Such contention might lead to unfairness, and poor per-customer latency and throughput guarantees, thus the SASE provider&#8217;s inability to honor any kind of network Service Level Objectives.   As a result, it is necessary to design some traffic policing scheme at the ingress of the system (i.e., at the tunnel termination point), that would perform traffic scheduling (i.e., delaying packets belonging to a flow to reduce its burstiness and impact on the downstream system&#8217;s buffers) and/or selective packet dropping, to ensure fairness among all tunnels.   While there are plenty of theoretical algorithms that ensure a high level of fairness between flows (for various definitions of fairness), those very often suffer from scalability issues due to the necessity of tracking the state of the different flows traversing the system. Moreover, even for algorithms whose scalability have been studied from a purely &#8220;computer-science&#8221; perspective (usually meaning asymptotic complexity for a large number of flows), such an approach is insufficient at the levels of throughput targeted by a high-performance software data plane.   In fact, properties such as cache-friendliness, or code vectorizability are more important when the per-packet CPU-budget for traffic policing is in the order of a hundred cycles. To the best of our knowledge, very little research has been done with this perspective in mind                      INTERNSHIP GOALS             This internship main general goal is to study traffic policing algorithms from the aforementioned perspective, in the context of SASE ingress. This can be carried out by means of:   &#8226;	A review of state-of-the-art traffic policing algorithms that ensure reasonable levels of fairness at a minimal complexity   &#8226;	Select among this list, those which have properties compatible with a high-performance packet-forwarding engine (review data structure cache locality for example)   &#8226;	Propose efficient implementations in a software dataplane (either the Linux Kernel, Click, or VPP)   &#8226;	Propose a quantitative theoretical and experimental analysis of those algorithms going beyond traditional asymptotical analysis   &#8226;	Release produced code in open source and theoretical and experimental results as an academical publication                       EXPECTED SKILLS                      C programming   Good understanding of core principles of packet switched networks and queuing networks   Ability to jump into a complex code base and hack into it   Ability to read and understand computer science/computer networking research papers   Academic English reading/writing skills                                                                     The Meraki cloud supports millions of customer devices from 10+data centres around the world.

We&#8217;re building an employee experience that includes appreciation, belonging, growth, and purpose for everyone.              Start date: April-June 2023  Duration: 6 months  Location: Hybrid, Paris office &amp; home office                        TEAM OVERVIEW            The intern will be part of the Cloud Native Data Plane (CNDP) team within the Security Business Group (SBG) at Cisco. This team contributes to many projects across SBG by developing, maintaining, and customizing the Vector Packet Processor (VPP), which is an open source piece of software part of the fd.io project. VPP is recognized as the most performant software-based packet forwarder available. This makes the CNDP team the ideal place to learn about high-performance data-plane programming.                       TOPIC OVERVIEW                       The Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) initiative consists of providing end-users with a combination of Software Defined WAN (SD-WAN) services and Network security services, all running in the cloud. In this context, SASE-providers must terminate a very large number of tunnels of various types (e.g., IPsec) in their own infrastructure. Unless the infrastructure is heavily overprovisioned with regards to the aggregated throughput of all the tunnels, Input/Output (I/O) and Central Processing Unit (CPU) resource contention is inevitable at the ingress of this infrastructure. Such contention might lead to unfairness, and poor per-customer latency and throughput guarantees, thus the SASE provider&#8217;s inability to honor any kind of network Service Level Objectives.   As a result, it is necessary to design some traffic policing scheme at the ingress of the system (i.e., at the tunnel termination point), that would perform traffic scheduling (i.e., delaying packets belonging to a flow to reduce its burstiness and impact on the downstream system&#8217;s buffers) and/or selective packet dropping, to ensure fairness among all tunnels.   While there are plenty of theoretical algorithms that ensure a high level of fairness between flows (for various definitions of fairness), those very often suffer from scalability issues due to the necessity of tracking the state of the different flows traversing the system. Moreover, even for algorithms whose scalability have been studied from a purely &#8220;computer-science&#8221; perspective (usually meaning asymptotic complexity for a large number of flows), such an approach is insufficient at the levels of throughput targeted by a high-performance software data plane.   In fact, properties such as cache-friendliness, or code vectorizability are more important when the per-packet CPU-budget for traffic policing is in the order of a hundred cycles. To the best of our knowledge, very little research has been done with this perspective in mind                      INTERNSHIP GOALS             This internship main general goal is to study traffic policing algorithms from the aforementioned perspective, in the context of SASE ingress. This can be carried out by means of:   &#8226;	A review of state-of-the-art traffic policing algorithms that ensure reasonable levels of fairness at a minimal complexity   &#8226;	Select among this list, those which have properties compatible with a high-performance packet-forwarding engine (review data structure cache locality for example)   &#8226;	Propose efficient implementations in a software dataplane (either the Linux Kernel, Click, or VPP)   &#8226;	Propose a quantitative theoretical and experimental analysis of those algorithms going beyond traditional asymptotical analysis   &#8226;	Release produced code in open source and theoretical and experimental results as an academical publication                       EXPECTED SKILLS                      C programming   Good understanding of core principles of packet switched networks and queuing networks   Ability to jump into a complex code base and hack into it   Ability to read and understand computer science/computer networking research papers   Academic English reading/writing skills                                                                     The Meraki cloud supports millions of customer devices from 10+data centres around the world.

We&#8217;re building an employee experience that includes appreciation, belonging, growth, and purpose for everyone.              Start date: April-June 2023  Duration: 6 months  Location: Hybrid, Paris office &amp; home office                        TEAM OVERVIEW            The intern will be part of the Cloud Native Data Plane (CNDP) team within the Security Business Group (SBG) at Cisco. This team contributes to many projects across SBG by developing, maintaining, and customizing the Vector Packet Processor (VPP), which is an open source piece of software part of the fd.io project. VPP is recognized as the most performant software-based packet forwarder available. This makes the CNDP team the ideal place to learn about high-performance data-plane programming.                       TOPIC OVERVIEW                       The Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) initiative consists of providing end-users with a combination of Software Defined WAN (SD-WAN) services and Network security services, all running in the cloud. In this context, SASE-providers must terminate a very large number of tunnels of various types (e.g., IPsec) in their own infrastructure. Unless the infrastructure is heavily overprovisioned with regards to the aggregated throughput of all the tunnels, Input/Output (I/O) and Central Processing Unit (CPU) resource contention is inevitable at the ingress of this infrastructure. Such contention might lead to unfairness, and poor per-customer latency and throughput guarantees, thus the SASE provider&#8217;s inability to honor any kind of network Service Level Objectives.   As a result, it is necessary to design some traffic policing scheme at the ingress of the system (i.e., at the tunnel termination point), that would perform traffic scheduling (i.e., delaying packets belonging to a flow to reduce its burstiness and impact on the downstream system&#8217;s buffers) and/or selective packet dropping, to ensure fairness among all tunnels.   While there are plenty of theoretical algorithms that ensure a high level of fairness between flows (for various definitions of fairness), those very often suffer from scalability issues due to the necessity of tracking the state of the different flows traversing the system. Moreover, even for algorithms whose scalability have been studied from a purely &#8220;computer-science&#8221; perspective (usually meaning asymptotic complexity for a large number of flows), such an approach is insufficient at the levels of throughput targeted by a high-performance software data plane.   In fact, properties such as cache-friendliness, or code vectorizability are more important when the per-packet CPU-budget for traffic policing is in the order of a hundred cycles. To the best of our knowledge, very little research has been done with this perspective in mind                      INTERNSHIP GOALS             This internship main general goal is to study traffic policing algorithms from the aforementioned perspective, in the context of SASE ingress. This can be carried out by means of:   &#8226;	A review of state-of-the-art traffic policing algorithms that ensure reasonable levels of fairness at a minimal complexity   &#8226;	Select among this list, those which have properties compatible with a high-performance packet-forwarding engine (review data structure cache locality for example)   &#8226;	Propose efficient implementations in a software dataplane (either the Linux Kernel, Click, or VPP)   &#8226;	Propose a quantitative theoretical and experimental analysis of those algorithms going beyond traditional asymptotical analysis   &#8226;	Release produced code in open source and theoretical and experimental results as an academical publication                       EXPECTED SKILLS                      C programming   Good understanding of core principles of packet switched networks and queuing networks   Ability to jump into a complex code base and hack into it   Ability to read and understand computer science/computer networking research papers   Academic English reading/writing skills                                                                     The Meraki cloud supports millions of customer devices from 10+data centres around the world.

We&#8217;re building an employee experience that includes appreciation, belonging, growth, and purpose for everyone.              Start date: April-June 2023  Duration: 6 months  Location: Hybrid, Paris office &amp; home office                        TEAM OVERVIEW            The intern will be part of the Cloud Native Data Plane (CNDP) team within the Security Business Group (SBG) at Cisco. This team contributes to many projects across SBG by developing, maintaining, and customizing the Vector Packet Processor (VPP), which is an open source piece of software part of the fd.io project. VPP is recognized as the most performant software-based packet forwarder available. This makes the CNDP team the ideal place to learn about high-performance data-plane programming.                       TOPIC OVERVIEW                       The Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) initiative consists of providing end-users with a combination of Software Defined WAN (SD-WAN) services and Network security services, all running in the cloud. In this context, SASE-providers must terminate a very large number of tunnels of various types (e.g., IPsec) in their own infrastructure. Unless the infrastructure is heavily overprovisioned with regards to the aggregated throughput of all the tunnels, Input/Output (I/O) and Central Processing Unit (CPU) resource contention is inevitable at the ingress of this infrastructure. Such contention might lead to unfairness, and poor per-customer latency and throughput guarantees, thus the SASE provider&#8217;s inability to honor any kind of network Service Level Objectives.   As a result, it is necessary to design some traffic policing scheme at the ingress of the system (i.e., at the tunnel termination point), that would perform traffic scheduling (i.e., delaying packets belonging to a flow to reduce its burstiness and impact on the downstream system&#8217;s buffers) and/or selective packet dropping, to ensure fairness among all tunnels.   While there are plenty of theoretical algorithms that ensure a high level of fairness between flows (for various definitions of fairness), those very often suffer from scalability issues due to the necessity of tracking the state of the different flows traversing the system. Moreover, even for algorithms whose scalability have been studied from a purely &#8220;computer-science&#8221; perspective (usually meaning asymptotic complexity for a large number of flows), such an approach is insufficient at the levels of throughput targeted by a high-performance software data plane.   In fact, properties such as cache-friendliness, or code vectorizability are more important when the per-packet CPU-budget for traffic policing is in the order of a hundred cycles. To the best of our knowledge, very little research has been done with this perspective in mind                      INTERNSHIP GOALS             This internship main general goal is to study traffic policing algorithms from the aforementioned perspective, in the context of SASE ingress. This can be carried out by means of:   &#8226;	A review of state-of-the-art traffic policing algorithms that ensure reasonable levels of fairness at a minimal complexity   &#8226;	Select among this list, those which have properties compatible with a high-performance packet-forwarding engine (review data structure cache locality for example)   &#8226;	Propose efficient implementations in a software dataplane (either the Linux Kernel, Click, or VPP)   &#8226;	Propose a quantitative theoretical and experimental analysis of those algorithms going beyond traditional asymptotical analysis   &#8226;	Release produced code in open source and theoretical and experimental results as an academical publication                       EXPECTED SKILLS                      C programming   Good understanding of core principles of packet switched networks and queuing networks   Ability to jump into a complex code base and hack into it   Ability to read and understand computer science/computer networking research papers   Academic English reading/writing skills                                                                     The Meraki cloud supports millions of customer devices from 10+data centres around the world.

We&#8217;re building an employee experience that includes appreciation, belonging, growth, and purpose for everyone.              Start date: April-June 2023  Duration: 6 months  Location: Hybrid, Paris office &amp; home office                        TEAM OVERVIEW            The intern will be part of the Cloud Native Data Plane (CNDP) team within the Security Business Group (SBG) at Cisco. This team contributes to many projects across SBG by developing, maintaining, and customizing the Vector Packet Processor (VPP), which is an open source piece of software part of the fd.io project. VPP is recognized as the most performant software-based packet forwarder available. This makes the CNDP team the ideal place to learn about high-performance data-plane programming.                       TOPIC OVERVIEW                       The Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) initiative consists of providing end-users with a combination of Software Defined WAN (SD-WAN) services and Network security services, all running in the cloud. In this context, SASE-providers must terminate a very large number of tunnels of various types (e.g., IPsec) in their own infrastructure. Unless the infrastructure is heavily overprovisioned with regards to the aggregated throughput of all the tunnels, Input/Output (I/O) and Central Processing Unit (CPU) resource contention is inevitable at the ingress of this infrastructure. Such contention might lead to unfairness, and poor per-customer latency and throughput guarantees, thus the SASE provider&#8217;s inability to honor any kind of network Service Level Objectives.   As a result, it is necessary to design some traffic policing scheme at the ingress of the system (i.e., at the tunnel termination point), that would perform traffic scheduling (i.e., delaying packets belonging to a flow to reduce its burstiness and impact on the downstream system&#8217;s buffers) and/or selective packet dropping, to ensure fairness among all tunnels.   While there are plenty of theoretical algorithms that ensure a high level of fairness between flows (for various definitions of fairness), those very often suffer from scalability issues due to the necessity of tracking the state of the different flows traversing the system. Moreover, even for algorithms whose scalability have been studied from a purely &#8220;computer-science&#8221; perspective (usually meaning asymptotic complexity for a large number of flows), such an approach is insufficient at the levels of throughput targeted by a high-performance software data plane.   In fact, properties such as cache-friendliness, or code vectorizability are more important when the per-packet CPU-budget for traffic policing is in the order of a hundred cycles. To the best of our knowledge, very little research has been done with this perspective in mind                      INTERNSHIP GOALS             This internship main general goal is to study traffic policing algorithms from the aforementioned perspective, in the context of SASE ingress. This can be carried out by means of:   &#8226;	A review of state-of-the-art traffic policing algorithms that ensure reasonable levels of fairness at a minimal complexity   &#8226;	Select among this list, those which have properties compatible with a high-performance packet-forwarding engine (review data structure cache locality for example)   &#8226;	Propose efficient implementations in a software dataplane (either the Linux Kernel, Click, or VPP)   &#8226;	Propose a quantitative theoretical and experimental analysis of those algorithms going beyond traditional asymptotical analysis   &#8226;	Release produced code in open source and theoretical and experimental results as an academical publication                       EXPECTED SKILLS                      C programming   Good understanding of core principles of packet switched networks and queuing networks   Ability to jump into a complex code base and hack into it   Ability to read and understand computer science/computer networking research papers   Academic English reading/writing skills                                                                     The Meraki cloud supports millions of customer devices from 10+data centres around the world.

We&#8217;re building an employee experience that includes appreciation, belonging, growth, and purpose for everyone.              Start date: April-June 2023  Duration: 6 months  Location: Hybrid, Paris office &amp; home office                        TEAM OVERVIEW            The intern will be part of the Cloud Native Data Plane (CNDP) team within the Security Business Group (SBG) at Cisco. This team contributes to many projects across SBG by developing, maintaining, and customizing the Vector Packet Processor (VPP), which is an open source piece of software part of the fd.io project. VPP is recognized as the most performant software-based packet forwarder available. This makes the CNDP team the ideal place to learn about high-performance data-plane programming.                       TOPIC OVERVIEW                       The Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) initiative consists of providing end-users with a combination of Software Defined WAN (SD-WAN) services and Network security services, all running in the cloud. In this context, SASE-providers must terminate a very large number of tunnels of various types (e.g., IPsec) in their own infrastructure. Unless the infrastructure is heavily overprovisioned with regards to the aggregated throughput of all the tunnels, Input/Output (I/O) and Central Processing Unit (CPU) resource contention is inevitable at the ingress of this infrastructure. Such contention might lead to unfairness, and poor per-customer latency and throughput guarantees, thus the SASE provider&#8217;s inability to honor any kind of network Service Level Objectives.   As a result, it is necessary to design some traffic policing scheme at the ingress of the system (i.e., at the tunnel termination point), that would perform traffic scheduling (i.e., delaying packets belonging to a flow to reduce its burstiness and impact on the downstream system&#8217;s buffers) and/or selective packet dropping, to ensure fairness among all tunnels.   While there are plenty of theoretical algorithms that ensure a high level of fairness between flows (for various definitions of fairness), those very often suffer from scalability issues due to the necessity of tracking the state of the different flows traversing the system. Moreover, even for algorithms whose scalability have been studied from a purely &#8220;computer-science&#8221; perspective (usually meaning asymptotic complexity for a large number of flows), such an approach is insufficient at the levels of throughput targeted by a high-performance software data plane.   In fact, properties such as cache-friendliness, or code vectorizability are more important when the per-packet CPU-budget for traffic policing is in the order of a hundred cycles. To the best of our knowledge, very little research has been done with this perspective in mind                      INTERNSHIP GOALS             This internship main general goal is to study traffic policing algorithms from the aforementioned perspective, in the context of SASE ingress. This can be carried out by means of:   &#8226;	A review of state-of-the-art traffic policing algorithms that ensure reasonable levels of fairness at a minimal complexity   &#8226;	Select among this list, those which have properties compatible with a high-performance packet-forwarding engine (review data structure cache locality for example)   &#8226;	Propose efficient implementations in a software dataplane (either the Linux Kernel, Click, or VPP)   &#8226;	Propose a quantitative theoretical and experimental analysis of those algorithms going beyond traditional asymptotical analysis   &#8226;	Release produced code in open source and theoretical and experimental results as an academical publication                       EXPECTED SKILLS                      C programming   Good understanding of core principles of packet switched networks and queuing networks   Ability to jump into a complex code base and hack into it   Ability to read and understand computer science/computer networking research papers   Academic English reading/writing skills                                                                     The Meraki cloud supports millions of customer devices from 10+data centres around the world.

We&#8217;re building an employee experience that includes appreciation, belonging, growth, and purpose for everyone.              Start date: April-June 2023  Duration: 6 months  Location: Hybrid, Paris office &amp; home office                        TEAM OVERVIEW            The intern will be part of the Cloud Native Data Plane (CNDP) team within the Security Business Group (SBG) at Cisco. This team contributes to many projects across SBG by developing, maintaining, and customizing the Vector Packet Processor (VPP), which is an open source piece of software part of the fd.io project. VPP is recognized as the most performant software-based packet forwarder available. This makes the CNDP team the ideal place to learn about high-performance data-plane programming.                       TOPIC OVERVIEW                       The Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) initiative consists of providing end-users with a combination of Software Defined WAN (SD-WAN) services and Network security services, all running in the cloud. In this context, SASE-providers must terminate a very large number of tunnels of various types (e.g., IPsec) in their own infrastructure. Unless the infrastructure is heavily overprovisioned with regards to the aggregated throughput of all the tunnels, Input/Output (I/O) and Central Processing Unit (CPU) resource contention is inevitable at the ingress of this infrastructure. Such contention might lead to unfairness, and poor per-customer latency and throughput guarantees, thus the SASE provider&#8217;s inability to honor any kind of network Service Level Objectives.   As a result, it is necessary to design some traffic policing scheme at the ingress of the system (i.e., at the tunnel termination point), that would perform traffic scheduling (i.e., delaying packets belonging to a flow to reduce its burstiness and impact on the downstream system&#8217;s buffers) and/or selective packet dropping, to ensure fairness among all tunnels.   While there are plenty of theoretical algorithms that ensure a high level of fairness between flows (for various definitions of fairness), those very often suffer from scalability issues due to the necessity of tracking the state of the different flows traversing the system. Moreover, even for algorithms whose scalability have been studied from a purely &#8220;computer-science&#8221; perspective (usually meaning asymptotic complexity for a large number of flows), such an approach is insufficient at the levels of throughput targeted by a high-performance software data plane.   In fact, properties such as cache-friendliness, or code vectorizability are more important when the per-packet CPU-budget for traffic policing is in the order of a hundred cycles. To the best of our knowledge, very little research has been done with this perspective in mind                      INTERNSHIP GOALS             This internship main general goal is to study traffic policing algorithms from the aforementioned perspective, in the context of SASE ingress. This can be carried out by means of:   &#8226;	A review of state-of-the-art traffic policing algorithms that ensure reasonable levels of fairness at a minimal complexity   &#8226;	Select among this list, those which have properties compatible with a high-performance packet-forwarding engine (review data structure cache locality for example)   &#8226;	Propose efficient implementations in a software dataplane (either the Linux Kernel, Click, or VPP)   &#8226;	Propose a quantitative theoretical and experimental analysis of those algorithms going beyond traditional asymptotical analysis   &#8226;	Release produced code in open source and theoretical and experimental results as an academical publication                       EXPECTED SKILLS                      C programming   Good understanding of core principles of packet switched networks and queuing networks   Ability to jump into a complex code base and hack into it   Ability to read and understand computer science/computer networking research papers   Academic English reading/writing skills                                                                     The Meraki cloud supports millions of customer devices from 10+data centres around the world.

We&#8217;re confronting the status quo with the power of diversity, inclusion, and teamwork. When we connect different perspectives, we can achieve new possibilities, encourage innovation and release the full potential of our people. We&#8217;re building an employee experience that includes appreciation, belonging, growth, and purpose for everyone.              Start date: April-June 2023  Duration: 6 months  Location: Hybrid, Paris office &amp; home office                        TEAM OVERVIEW            The intern will be part of the Cloud Native Data Plane (CNDP) team within the Security Business Group (SBG) at Cisco. This team contributes to many projects across SBG by developing, maintaining, and customizing the Vector Packet Processor (VPP), which is an open source piece of software part of the fd.io project. VPP is recognized as the most performant software-based packet forwarder available. This makes the CNDP team the ideal place to learn about high-performance data-plane programming.                       TOPIC OVERVIEW                       The Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) initiative consists of providing end-users with a combination of Software Defined WAN (SD-WAN) services and Network security services, all running in the cloud. In this context, SASE-providers must terminate a very large number of tunnels of various types (e.g., IPsec) in their own infrastructure. Unless the infrastructure is heavily overprovisioned with regards to the aggregated throughput of all the tunnels, Input/Output (I/O) and Central Processing Unit (CPU) resource contention is inevitable at the ingress of this infrastructure. Such contention might lead to unfairness, and poor per-customer latency and throughput guarantees, thus the SASE provider&#8217;s inability to honor any kind of network Service Level Objectives.   As a result, it is necessary to design some traffic policing scheme at the ingress of the system (i.e., at the tunnel termination point), that would perform traffic scheduling (i.e., delaying packets belonging to a flow to reduce its burstiness and impact on the downstream system&#8217;s buffers) and/or selective packet dropping, to ensure fairness among all tunnels.   While there are plenty of theoretical algorithms that ensure a high level of fairness between flows (for various definitions of fairness), those very often suffer from scalability issues due to the necessity of tracking the state of the different flows traversing the system. Moreover, even for algorithms whose scalability have been studied from a purely &#8220;computer-science&#8221; perspective (usually meaning asymptotic complexity for a large number of flows), such an approach is insufficient at the levels of throughput targeted by a high-performance software data plane.   In fact, properties such as cache-friendliness, or code vectorizability are more important when the per-packet CPU-budget for traffic policing is in the order of a hundred cycles. To the best of our knowledge, very little research has been done with this perspective in mind                      INTERNSHIP GOALS             This internship main general goal is to study traffic policing algorithms from the aforementioned perspective, in the context of SASE ingress. This can be carried out by means of:   &#8226;	A review of state-of-the-art traffic policing algorithms that ensure reasonable levels of fairness at a minimal complexity   &#8226;	Select among this list, those which have properties compatible with a high-performance packet-forwarding engine (review data structure cache locality for example)   &#8226;	Propose efficient implementations in a software dataplane (either the Linux Kernel, Click, or VPP)   &#8226;	Propose a quantitative theoretical and experimental analysis of those algorithms going beyond traditional asymptotical analysis   &#8226;	Release produced code in open source and theoretical and experimental results as an academical publication                       EXPECTED SKILLS                      C programming   Good understanding of core principles of packet switched networks and queuing networks   Ability to jump into a complex code base and hack into it   Ability to read and understand computer science/computer networking research papers   Academic English reading/writing skills                                                                     The Meraki cloud supports millions of customer devices from 10+data centres around the world.

We&#8217;re building an employee experience that includes appreciation, belonging, growth, and purpose for everyone.              Start date: April-June 2023  Duration: 6 months  Location: Hybrid, Paris office &amp; home office                        TEAM OVERVIEW            The intern will be part of the Cloud Native Data Plane (CNDP) team within the Security Business Group (SBG) at Cisco. This team contributes to many projects across SBG by developing, maintaining, and customizing the Vector Packet Processor (VPP), which is an open source piece of software part of the fd.io project. VPP is recognized as the most performant software-based packet forwarder available. This makes the CNDP team the ideal place to learn about high-performance data-plane programming.                       TOPIC OVERVIEW                       The Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) initiative consists of providing end-users with a combination of Software Defined WAN (SD-WAN) services and Network security services, all running in the cloud. In this context, SASE-providers must terminate a very large number of tunnels of various types (e.g., IPsec) in their own infrastructure. Unless the infrastructure is heavily overprovisioned with regards to the aggregated throughput of all the tunnels, Input/Output (I/O) and Central Processing Unit (CPU) resource contention is inevitable at the ingress of this infrastructure. Such contention might lead to unfairness, and poor per-customer latency and throughput guarantees, thus the SASE provider&#8217;s inability to honor any kind of network Service Level Objectives.   As a result, it is necessary to design some traffic policing scheme at the ingress of the system (i.e., at the tunnel termination point), that would perform traffic scheduling (i.e., delaying packets belonging to a flow to reduce its burstiness and impact on the downstream system&#8217;s buffers) and/or selective packet dropping, to ensure fairness among all tunnels.   While there are plenty of theoretical algorithms that ensure a high level of fairness between flows (for various definitions of fairness), those very often suffer from scalability issues due to the necessity of tracking the state of the different flows traversing the system. Moreover, even for algorithms whose scalability have been studied from a purely &#8220;computer-science&#8221; perspective (usually meaning asymptotic complexity for a large number of flows), such an approach is insufficient at the levels of throughput targeted by a high-performance software data plane.   In fact, properties such as cache-friendliness, or code vectorizability are more important when the per-packet CPU-budget for traffic policing is in the order of a hundred cycles. To the best of our knowledge, very little research has been done with this perspective in mind                      INTERNSHIP GOALS             This internship main general goal is to study traffic policing algorithms from the aforementioned perspective, in the context of SASE ingress. This can be carried out by means of:   &#8226;	A review of state-of-the-art traffic policing algorithms that ensure reasonable levels of fairness at a minimal complexity   &#8226;	Select among this list, those which have properties compatible with a high-performance packet-forwarding engine (review data structure cache locality for example)   &#8226;	Propose efficient implementations in a software dataplane (either the Linux Kernel, Click, or VPP)   &#8226;	Propose a quantitative theoretical and experimental analysis of those algorithms going beyond traditional asymptotical analysis   &#8226;	Release produced code in open source and theoretical and experimental results as an academical publication                       EXPECTED SKILLS                      C programming   Good understanding of core principles of packet switched networks and queuing networks   Ability to jump into a complex code base and hack into it   Ability to read and understand computer science/computer networking research papers   Academic English reading/writing skills                                                                     The Meraki cloud supports millions of customer devices from 10+data centres around the world.

We&#8217;re building an employee experience that includes appreciation, belonging, growth, and purpose for everyone.              Start date: April-June 2023  Duration: 6 months  Location: Hybrid, Paris office &amp; home office                        TEAM OVERVIEW            The intern will be part of the Cloud Native Data Plane (CNDP) team within the Security Business Group (SBG) at Cisco. This team contributes to many projects across SBG by developing, maintaining, and customizing the Vector Packet Processor (VPP), which is an open source piece of software part of the fd.io project. VPP is recognized as the most performant software-based packet forwarder available. This makes the CNDP team the ideal place to learn about high-performance data-plane programming.                       TOPIC OVERVIEW                       The Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) initiative consists of providing end-users with a combination of Software Defined WAN (SD-WAN) services and Network security services, all running in the cloud. In this context, SASE-providers must terminate a very large number of tunnels of various types (e.g., IPsec) in their own infrastructure. Unless the infrastructure is heavily overprovisioned with regards to the aggregated throughput of all the tunnels, Input/Output (I/O) and Central Processing Unit (CPU) resource contention is inevitable at the ingress of this infrastructure. Such contention might lead to unfairness, and poor per-customer latency and throughput guarantees, thus the SASE provider&#8217;s inability to honor any kind of network Service Level Objectives.   As a result, it is necessary to design some traffic policing scheme at the ingress of the system (i.e., at the tunnel termination point), that would perform traffic scheduling (i.e., delaying packets belonging to a flow to reduce its burstiness and impact on the downstream system&#8217;s buffers) and/or selective packet dropping, to ensure fairness among all tunnels.   While there are plenty of theoretical algorithms that ensure a high level of fairness between flows (for various definitions of fairness), those very often suffer from scalability issues due to the necessity of tracking the state of the different flows traversing the system. Moreover, even for algorithms whose scalability have been studied from a purely &#8220;computer-science&#8221; perspective (usually meaning asymptotic complexity for a large number of flows), such an approach is insufficient at the levels of throughput targeted by a high-performance software data plane.   In fact, properties such as cache-friendliness, or code vectorizability are more important when the per-packet CPU-budget for traffic policing is in the order of a hundred cycles. To the best of our knowledge, very little research has been done with this perspective in mind                      INTERNSHIP GOALS             This internship main general goal is to study traffic policing algorithms from the aforementioned perspective, in the context of SASE ingress. This can be carried out by means of:   &#8226;	A review of state-of-the-art traffic policing algorithms that ensure reasonable levels of fairness at a minimal complexity   &#8226;	Select among this list, those which have properties compatible with a high-performance packet-forwarding engine (review data structure cache locality for example)   &#8226;	Propose efficient implementations in a software dataplane (either the Linux Kernel, Click, or VPP)   &#8226;	Propose a quantitative theoretical and experimental analysis of those algorithms going beyond traditional asymptotical analysis   &#8226;	Release produced code in open source and theoretical and experimental results as an academical publication                       EXPECTED SKILLS                      C programming   Good understanding of core principles of packet switched networks and queuing networks   Ability to jump into a complex code base and hack into it   Ability to read and understand computer science/computer networking research papers   Academic English reading/writing skills                                                                     The Meraki cloud supports millions of customer devices from 10+data centres around the world.

We&#8217;re building an employee experience that includes appreciation, belonging, growth, and purpose for everyone.              Start date: April-June 2023  Duration: 6 months  Location: Hybrid, Paris office &amp; home office                        TEAM OVERVIEW            The intern will be part of the Cloud Native Data Plane (CNDP) team within the Security Business Group (SBG) at Cisco. This team contributes to many projects across SBG by developing, maintaining, and customizing the Vector Packet Processor (VPP), which is an open source piece of software part of the fd.io project. VPP is recognized as the most performant software-based packet forwarder available. This makes the CNDP team the ideal place to learn about high-performance data-plane programming.                       TOPIC OVERVIEW                       The Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) initiative consists of providing end-users with a combination of Software Defined WAN (SD-WAN) services and Network security services, all running in the cloud. In this context, SASE-providers must terminate a very large number of tunnels of various types (e.g., IPsec) in their own infrastructure. Unless the infrastructure is heavily overprovisioned with regards to the aggregated throughput of all the tunnels, Input/Output (I/O) and Central Processing Unit (CPU) resource contention is inevitable at the ingress of this infrastructure. Such contention might lead to unfairness, and poor per-customer latency and throughput guarantees, thus the SASE provider&#8217;s inability to honor any kind of network Service Level Objectives.   As a result, it is necessary to design some traffic policing scheme at the ingress of the system (i.e., at the tunnel termination point), that would perform traffic scheduling (i.e., delaying packets belonging to a flow to reduce its burstiness and impact on the downstream system&#8217;s buffers) and/or selective packet dropping, to ensure fairness among all tunnels.   While there are plenty of theoretical algorithms that ensure a high level of fairness between flows (for various definitions of fairness), those very often suffer from scalability issues due to the necessity of tracking the state of the different flows traversing the system. Moreover, even for algorithms whose scalability have been studied from a purely &#8220;computer-science&#8221; perspective (usually meaning asymptotic complexity for a large number of flows), such an approach is insufficient at the levels of throughput targeted by a high-performance software data plane.   In fact, properties such as cache-friendliness, or code vectorizability are more important when the per-packet CPU-budget for traffic policing is in the order of a hundred cycles. To the best of our knowledge, very little research has been done with this perspective in mind                      INTERNSHIP GOALS             This internship main general goal is to study traffic policing algorithms from the aforementioned perspective, in the context of SASE ingress. This can be carried out by means of:   &#8226;	A review of state-of-the-art traffic policing algorithms that ensure reasonable levels of fairness at a minimal complexity   &#8226;	Select among this list, those which have properties compatible with a high-performance packet-forwarding engine (review data structure cache locality for example)   &#8226;	Propose efficient implementations in a software dataplane (either the Linux Kernel, Click, or VPP)   &#8226;	Propose a quantitative theoretical and experimental analysis of those algorithms going beyond traditional asymptotical analysis   &#8226;	Release produced code in open source and theoretical and experimental results as an academical publication                       EXPECTED SKILLS                      C programming   Good understanding of core principles of packet switched networks and queuing networks   Ability to jump into a complex code base and hack into it   Ability to read and understand computer science/computer networking research papers   Academic English reading/writing skills                                                                     The Meraki cloud supports millions of customer devices from 10+data centres around the world.

We&#8217;re building an employee experience that includes appreciation, belonging, growth, and purpose for everyone.              Start date: April-June 2023  Duration: 6 months  Location: Hybrid, Paris office &amp; home office                        TEAM OVERVIEW            The intern will be part of the Cloud Native Data Plane (CNDP) team within the Security Business Group (SBG) at Cisco. This team contributes to many projects across SBG by developing, maintaining, and customizing the Vector Packet Processor (VPP), which is an open source piece of software part of the fd.io project. VPP is recognized as the most performant software-based packet forwarder available. This makes the CNDP team the ideal place to learn about high-performance data-plane programming.                       TOPIC OVERVIEW                       The Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) initiative consists of providing end-users with a combination of Software Defined WAN (SD-WAN) services and Network security services, all running in the cloud. In this context, SASE-providers must terminate a very large number of tunnels of various types (e.g., IPsec) in their own infrastructure. Unless the infrastructure is heavily overprovisioned with regards to the aggregated throughput of all the tunnels, Input/Output (I/O) and Central Processing Unit (CPU) resource contention is inevitable at the ingress of this infrastructure. Such contention might lead to unfairness, and poor per-customer latency and throughput guarantees, thus the SASE provider&#8217;s inability to honor any kind of network Service Level Objectives.   As a result, it is necessary to design some traffic policing scheme at the ingress of the system (i.e., at the tunnel termination point), that would perform traffic scheduling (i.e., delaying packets belonging to a flow to reduce its burstiness and impact on the downstream system&#8217;s buffers) and/or selective packet dropping, to ensure fairness among all tunnels.   While there are plenty of theoretical algorithms that ensure a high level of fairness between flows (for various definitions of fairness), those very often suffer from scalability issues due to the necessity of tracking the state of the different flows traversing the system. Moreover, even for algorithms whose scalability have been studied from a purely &#8220;computer-science&#8221; perspective (usually meaning asymptotic complexity for a large number of flows), such an approach is insufficient at the levels of throughput targeted by a high-performance software data plane.   In fact, properties such as cache-friendliness, or code vectorizability are more important when the per-packet CPU-budget for traffic policing is in the order of a hundred cycles. To the best of our knowledge, very little research has been done with this perspective in mind                      INTERNSHIP GOALS             This internship main general goal is to study traffic policing algorithms from the aforementioned perspective, in the context of SASE ingress. This can be carried out by means of:   &#8226;	A review of state-of-the-art traffic policing algorithms that ensure reasonable levels of fairness at a minimal complexity   &#8226;	Select among this list, those which have properties compatible with a high-performance packet-forwarding engine (review data structure cache locality for example)   &#8226;	Propose efficient implementations in a software dataplane (either the Linux Kernel, Click, or VPP)   &#8226;	Propose a quantitative theoretical and experimental analysis of those algorithms going beyond traditional asymptotical analysis   &#8226;	Release produced code in open source and theoretical and experimental results as an academical publication                       EXPECTED SKILLS                      C programming   Good understanding of core principles of packet switched networks and queuing networks   Ability to jump into a complex code base and hack into it   Ability to read and understand computer science/computer networking research papers   Academic English reading/writing skills                                                                     The Meraki cloud supports millions of customer devices from 10+data centres around the world.

Start date: April-June 2023  Duration: 6 months  Location: Hybrid, Paris office &amp; home office                        TEAM OVERVIEW            The intern will be part of the Cloud Native Data Plane (CNDP) team within the Security Business Group (SBG) at Cisco. This team contributes to many projects across SBG by developing, maintaining, and customizing the Vector Packet Processor (VPP), which is an open source piece of software part of the fd.io project. VPP is recognized as the most performant software-based packet forwarder available. This makes the CNDP team the ideal place to learn about high-performance data-plane programming.                       TOPIC OVERVIEW                       The Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) initiative consists of providing end-users with a combination of Software Defined WAN (SD-WAN) services and Network security services, all running in the cloud. In this context, SASE-providers must terminate a very large number of tunnels of various types (e.g., IPsec) in their own infrastructure. Unless the infrastructure is heavily overprovisioned with regards to the aggregated throughput of all the tunnels, Input/Output (I/O) and Central Processing Unit (CPU) resource contention is inevitable at the ingress of this infrastructure. Such contention might lead to unfairness, and poor per-customer latency and throughput guarantees, thus the SASE provider&#8217;s inability to honor any kind of network Service Level Objectives.   As a result, it is necessary to design some traffic policing scheme at the ingress of the system (i.e., at the tunnel termination point), that would perform traffic scheduling (i.e., delaying packets belonging to a flow to reduce its burstiness and impact on the downstream system&#8217;s buffers) and/or selective packet dropping, to ensure fairness among all tunnels.   While there are plenty of theoretical algorithms that ensure a high level of fairness between flows (for various definitions of fairness), those very often suffer from scalability issues due to the necessity of tracking the state of the different flows traversing the system. Moreover, even for algorithms whose scalability have been studied from a purely &#8220;computer-science&#8221; perspective (usually meaning asymptotic complexity for a large number of flows), such an approach is insufficient at the levels of throughput targeted by a high-performance software data plane.   In fact, properties such as cache-friendliness, or code vectorizability are more important when the per-packet CPU-budget for traffic policing is in the order of a hundred cycles.

We&#8217;re building an employee experience that includes appreciation, belonging, growth, and purpose for everyone.              Start date: April-June 2023  Duration: 6 months  Location: Hybrid, Paris office &amp; home office                        TEAM OVERVIEW            The intern will be part of the Cloud Native Data Plane (CNDP) team within the Security Business Group (SBG) at Cisco. This team contributes to many projects across SBG by developing, maintaining, and customizing the Vector Packet Processor (VPP), which is an open source piece of software part of the fd.io project. VPP is recognized as the most performant software-based packet forwarder available. This makes the CNDP team the ideal place to learn about high-performance data-plane programming.                       TOPIC OVERVIEW                       The Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) initiative consists of providing end-users with a combination of Software Defined WAN (SD-WAN) services and Network security services, all running in the cloud. In this context, SASE-providers must terminate a very large number of tunnels of various types (e.g., IPsec) in their own infrastructure. Unless the infrastructure is heavily overprovisioned with regards to the aggregated throughput of all the tunnels, Input/Output (I/O) and Central Processing Unit (CPU) resource contention is inevitable at the ingress of this infrastructure. Such contention might lead to unfairness, and poor per-customer latency and throughput guarantees, thus the SASE provider&#8217;s inability to honor any kind of network Service Level Objectives.   As a result, it is necessary to design some traffic policing scheme at the ingress of the system (i.e., at the tunnel termination point), that would perform traffic scheduling (i.e., delaying packets belonging to a flow to reduce its burstiness and impact on the downstream system&#8217;s buffers) and/or selective packet dropping, to ensure fairness among all tunnels.   While there are plenty of theoretical algorithms that ensure a high level of fairness between flows (for various definitions of fairness), those very often suffer from scalability issues due to the necessity of tracking the state of the different flows traversing the system. Moreover, even for algorithms whose scalability have been studied from a purely &#8220;computer-science&#8221; perspective (usually meaning asymptotic complexity for a large number of flows), such an approach is insufficient at the levels of throughput targeted by a high-performance software data plane.   In fact, properties such as cache-friendliness, or code vectorizability are more important when the per-packet CPU-budget for traffic policing is in the order of a hundred cycles. To the best of our knowledge, very little research has been done with this perspective in mind                      INTERNSHIP GOALS             This internship main general goal is to study traffic policing algorithms from the aforementioned perspective, in the context of SASE ingress. This can be carried out by means of:   &#8226;	A review of state-of-the-art traffic policing algorithms that ensure reasonable levels of fairness at a minimal complexity   &#8226;	Select among this list, those which have properties compatible with a high-performance packet-forwarding engine (review data structure cache locality for example)   &#8226;	Propose efficient implementations in a software dataplane (either the Linux Kernel, Click, or VPP)   &#8226;	Propose a quantitative theoretical and experimental analysis of those algorithms going beyond traditional asymptotical analysis   &#8226;	Release produced code in open source and theoretical and experimental results as an academical publication                       EXPECTED SKILLS                      C programming   Good understanding of core principles of packet switched networks and queuing networks   Ability to jump into a complex code base and hack into it   Ability to read and understand computer science/computer networking research papers   Academic English reading/writing skills                                                                     The Meraki cloud supports millions of customer devices from 10+data centres around the world.

Here&#8217;s how we do it.   We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&#8217;re ""old"" (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we&#8217;re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do - you can&#8217;t put us in a box!

We&#8217;re building an employee experience that includes appreciation, belonging, growth, and purpose for everyone.              Start date: April-June 2023  Duration: 6 months  Location: Hybrid, Paris office &amp; home office                        TEAM OVERVIEW            The intern will be part of the Cloud Native Data Plane (CNDP) team within the Security Business Group (SBG) at Cisco. This team contributes to many projects across SBG by developing, maintaining, and customizing the Vector Packet Processor (VPP), which is an open source piece of software part of the fd.io project. VPP is recognized as the most performant software-based packet forwarder available. This makes the CNDP team the ideal place to learn about high-performance data-plane programming.                       TOPIC OVERVIEW                       The Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) initiative consists of providing end-users with a combination of Software Defined WAN (SD-WAN) services and Network security services, all running in the cloud. In this context, SASE-providers must terminate a very large number of tunnels of various types (e.g., IPsec) in their own infrastructure. Unless the infrastructure is heavily overprovisioned with regards to the aggregated throughput of all the tunnels, Input/Output (I/O) and Central Processing Unit (CPU) resource contention is inevitable at the ingress of this infrastructure. Such contention might lead to unfairness, and poor per-customer latency and throughput guarantees, thus the SASE provider&#8217;s inability to honor any kind of network Service Level Objectives.   As a result, it is necessary to design some traffic policing scheme at the ingress of the system (i.e., at the tunnel termination point), that would perform traffic scheduling (i.e., delaying packets belonging to a flow to reduce its burstiness and impact on the downstream system&#8217;s buffers) and/or selective packet dropping, to ensure fairness among all tunnels.   While there are plenty of theoretical algorithms that ensure a high level of fairness between flows (for various definitions of fairness), those very often suffer from scalability issues due to the necessity of tracking the state of the different flows traversing the system. Moreover, even for algorithms whose scalability have been studied from a purely &#8220;computer-science&#8221; perspective (usually meaning asymptotic complexity for a large number of flows), such an approach is insufficient at the levels of throughput targeted by a high-performance software data plane.   In fact, properties such as cache-friendliness, or code vectorizability are more important when the per-packet CPU-budget for traffic policing is in the order of a hundred cycles. To the best of our knowledge, very little research has been done with this perspective in mind                      INTERNSHIP GOALS             This internship main general goal is to study traffic policing algorithms from the aforementioned perspective, in the context of SASE ingress. This can be carried out by means of:   &#8226;	A review of state-of-the-art traffic policing algorithms that ensure reasonable levels of fairness at a minimal complexity   &#8226;	Select among this list, those which have properties compatible with a high-performance packet-forwarding engine (review data structure cache locality for example)   &#8226;	Propose efficient implementations in a software dataplane (either the Linux Kernel, Click, or VPP)   &#8226;	Propose a quantitative theoretical and experimental analysis of those algorithms going beyond traditional asymptotical analysis   &#8226;	Release produced code in open source and theoretical and experimental results as an academical publication                       EXPECTED SKILLS                      C programming   Good understanding of core principles of packet switched networks and queuing networks   Ability to jump into a complex code base and hack into it   Ability to read and understand computer science/computer networking research papers   Academic English reading/writing skills                                                                     The Meraki cloud supports millions of customer devices from 10+data centres around the world.

Here&#8217;s how we do it.   We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&#8217;re ""old"" (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we&#8217;re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do - you can&#8217;t put us in a box!

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

We&#8217;re building an employee experience that includes appreciation, belonging, growth, and purpose for everyone.              Start date: April-June 2023  Duration: 6 months  Location: Hybrid, Paris office &amp; home office                        TEAM OVERVIEW            The intern will be part of the Cloud Native Data Plane (CNDP) team within the Security Business Group (SBG) at Cisco. This team contributes to many projects across SBG by developing, maintaining, and customizing the Vector Packet Processor (VPP), which is an open source piece of software part of the fd.io project. VPP is recognized as the most performant software-based packet forwarder available. This makes the CNDP team the ideal place to learn about high-performance data-plane programming.                       TOPIC OVERVIEW                       The Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) initiative consists of providing end-users with a combination of Software Defined WAN (SD-WAN) services and Network security services, all running in the cloud. In this context, SASE-providers must terminate a very large number of tunnels of various types (e.g., IPsec) in their own infrastructure. Unless the infrastructure is heavily overprovisioned with regards to the aggregated throughput of all the tunnels, Input/Output (I/O) and Central Processing Unit (CPU) resource contention is inevitable at the ingress of this infrastructure. Such contention might lead to unfairness, and poor per-customer latency and throughput guarantees, thus the SASE provider&#8217;s inability to honor any kind of network Service Level Objectives.   As a result, it is necessary to design some traffic policing scheme at the ingress of the system (i.e., at the tunnel termination point), that would perform traffic scheduling (i.e., delaying packets belonging to a flow to reduce its burstiness and impact on the downstream system&#8217;s buffers) and/or selective packet dropping, to ensure fairness among all tunnels.   While there are plenty of theoretical algorithms that ensure a high level of fairness between flows (for various definitions of fairness), those very often suffer from scalability issues due to the necessity of tracking the state of the different flows traversing the system. Moreover, even for algorithms whose scalability have been studied from a purely &#8220;computer-science&#8221; perspective (usually meaning asymptotic complexity for a large number of flows), such an approach is insufficient at the levels of throughput targeted by a high-performance software data plane.   In fact, properties such as cache-friendliness, or code vectorizability are more important when the per-packet CPU-budget for traffic policing is in the order of a hundred cycles. To the best of our knowledge, very little research has been done with this perspective in mind                      INTERNSHIP GOALS             This internship main general goal is to study traffic policing algorithms from the aforementioned perspective, in the context of SASE ingress. This can be carried out by means of:   &#8226;	A review of state-of-the-art traffic policing algorithms that ensure reasonable levels of fairness at a minimal complexity   &#8226;	Select among this list, those which have properties compatible with a high-performance packet-forwarding engine (review data structure cache locality for example)   &#8226;	Propose efficient implementations in a software dataplane (either the Linux Kernel, Click, or VPP)   &#8226;	Propose a quantitative theoretical and experimental analysis of those algorithms going beyond traditional asymptotical analysis   &#8226;	Release produced code in open source and theoretical and experimental results as an academical publication                       EXPECTED SKILLS                      C programming   Good understanding of core principles of packet switched networks and queuing networks   Ability to jump into a complex code base and hack into it   Ability to read and understand computer science/computer networking research papers   Academic English reading/writing skills                                                                     The Meraki cloud supports millions of customer devices from 10+data centres around the world.

We&#8217;re building an employee experience that includes appreciation, belonging, growth, and purpose for everyone.              Start date: April-June 2023  Duration: 6 months  Location: Hybrid, Paris office &amp; home office                        TEAM OVERVIEW            The intern will be part of the Cloud Native Data Plane (CNDP) team within the Security Business Group (SBG) at Cisco. This team contributes to many projects across SBG by developing, maintaining, and customizing the Vector Packet Processor (VPP), which is an open source piece of software part of the fd.io project. VPP is recognized as the most performant software-based packet forwarder available. This makes the CNDP team the ideal place to learn about high-performance data-plane programming.                       TOPIC OVERVIEW                       The Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) initiative consists of providing end-users with a combination of Software Defined WAN (SD-WAN) services and Network security services, all running in the cloud. In this context, SASE-providers must terminate a very large number of tunnels of various types (e.g., IPsec) in their own infrastructure. Unless the infrastructure is heavily overprovisioned with regards to the aggregated throughput of all the tunnels, Input/Output (I/O) and Central Processing Unit (CPU) resource contention is inevitable at the ingress of this infrastructure. Such contention might lead to unfairness, and poor per-customer latency and throughput guarantees, thus the SASE provider&#8217;s inability to honor any kind of network Service Level Objectives.   As a result, it is necessary to design some traffic policing scheme at the ingress of the system (i.e., at the tunnel termination point), that would perform traffic scheduling (i.e., delaying packets belonging to a flow to reduce its burstiness and impact on the downstream system&#8217;s buffers) and/or selective packet dropping, to ensure fairness among all tunnels.   While there are plenty of theoretical algorithms that ensure a high level of fairness between flows (for various definitions of fairness), those very often suffer from scalability issues due to the necessity of tracking the state of the different flows traversing the system. Moreover, even for algorithms whose scalability have been studied from a purely &#8220;computer-science&#8221; perspective (usually meaning asymptotic complexity for a large number of flows), such an approach is insufficient at the levels of throughput targeted by a high-performance software data plane.   In fact, properties such as cache-friendliness, or code vectorizability are more important when the per-packet CPU-budget for traffic policing is in the order of a hundred cycles. To the best of our knowledge, very little research has been done with this perspective in mind                      INTERNSHIP GOALS             This internship main general goal is to study traffic policing algorithms from the aforementioned perspective, in the context of SASE ingress. This can be carried out by means of:   &#8226;	A review of state-of-the-art traffic policing algorithms that ensure reasonable levels of fairness at a minimal complexity   &#8226;	Select among this list, those which have properties compatible with a high-performance packet-forwarding engine (review data structure cache locality for example)   &#8226;	Propose efficient implementations in a software dataplane (either the Linux Kernel, Click, or VPP)   &#8226;	Propose a quantitative theoretical and experimental analysis of those algorithms going beyond traditional asymptotical analysis   &#8226;	Release produced code in open source and theoretical and experimental results as an academical publication                       EXPECTED SKILLS                      C programming   Good understanding of core principles of packet switched networks and queuing networks   Ability to jump into a complex code base and hack into it   Ability to read and understand computer science/computer networking research papers   Academic English reading/writing skills                                                                     The Meraki cloud supports millions of customer devices from 10+data centres around the world.

We&#8217;re building an employee experience that includes appreciation, belonging, growth, and purpose for everyone.              Start date: April-June 2023  Duration: 6 months  Location: Hybrid, Paris office &amp; home office                        TEAM OVERVIEW            The intern will be part of the Cloud Native Data Plane (CNDP) team within the Security Business Group (SBG) at Cisco. This team contributes to many projects across SBG by developing, maintaining, and customizing the Vector Packet Processor (VPP), which is an open source piece of software part of the fd.io project. VPP is recognized as the most performant software-based packet forwarder available. This makes the CNDP team the ideal place to learn about high-performance data-plane programming.                       TOPIC OVERVIEW                       The Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) initiative consists of providing end-users with a combination of Software Defined WAN (SD-WAN) services and Network security services, all running in the cloud. In this context, SASE-providers must terminate a very large number of tunnels of various types (e.g., IPsec) in their own infrastructure. Unless the infrastructure is heavily overprovisioned with regards to the aggregated throughput of all the tunnels, Input/Output (I/O) and Central Processing Unit (CPU) resource contention is inevitable at the ingress of this infrastructure. Such contention might lead to unfairness, and poor per-customer latency and throughput guarantees, thus the SASE provider&#8217;s inability to honor any kind of network Service Level Objectives.   As a result, it is necessary to design some traffic policing scheme at the ingress of the system (i.e., at the tunnel termination point), that would perform traffic scheduling (i.e., delaying packets belonging to a flow to reduce its burstiness and impact on the downstream system&#8217;s buffers) and/or selective packet dropping, to ensure fairness among all tunnels.   While there are plenty of theoretical algorithms that ensure a high level of fairness between flows (for various definitions of fairness), those very often suffer from scalability issues due to the necessity of tracking the state of the different flows traversing the system. Moreover, even for algorithms whose scalability have been studied from a purely &#8220;computer-science&#8221; perspective (usually meaning asymptotic complexity for a large number of flows), such an approach is insufficient at the levels of throughput targeted by a high-performance software data plane.   In fact, properties such as cache-friendliness, or code vectorizability are more important when the per-packet CPU-budget for traffic policing is in the order of a hundred cycles. To the best of our knowledge, very little research has been done with this perspective in mind                      INTERNSHIP GOALS             This internship main general goal is to study traffic policing algorithms from the aforementioned perspective, in the context of SASE ingress. This can be carried out by means of:   &#8226;	A review of state-of-the-art traffic policing algorithms that ensure reasonable levels of fairness at a minimal complexity   &#8226;	Select among this list, those which have properties compatible with a high-performance packet-forwarding engine (review data structure cache locality for example)   &#8226;	Propose efficient implementations in a software dataplane (either the Linux Kernel, Click, or VPP)   &#8226;	Propose a quantitative theoretical and experimental analysis of those algorithms going beyond traditional asymptotical analysis   &#8226;	Release produced code in open source and theoretical and experimental results as an academical publication                       EXPECTED SKILLS                      C programming   Good understanding of core principles of packet switched networks and queuing networks   Ability to jump into a complex code base and hack into it   Ability to read and understand computer science/computer networking research papers   Academic English reading/writing skills                                                                     The Meraki cloud supports millions of customer devices from 10+data centres around the world.

We&#8217;re building an employee experience that includes appreciation, belonging, growth, and purpose for everyone.              Start date: April-June 2023  Duration: 6 months  Location: Hybrid, Paris office &amp; home office                        TEAM OVERVIEW            The intern will be part of the Cloud Native Data Plane (CNDP) team within the Security Business Group (SBG) at Cisco. This team contributes to many projects across SBG by developing, maintaining, and customizing the Vector Packet Processor (VPP), which is an open source piece of software part of the fd.io project. VPP is recognized as the most performant software-based packet forwarder available. This makes the CNDP team the ideal place to learn about high-performance data-plane programming.                       TOPIC OVERVIEW                       The Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) initiative consists of providing end-users with a combination of Software Defined WAN (SD-WAN) services and Network security services, all running in the cloud. In this context, SASE-providers must terminate a very large number of tunnels of various types (e.g., IPsec) in their own infrastructure. Unless the infrastructure is heavily overprovisioned with regards to the aggregated throughput of all the tunnels, Input/Output (I/O) and Central Processing Unit (CPU) resource contention is inevitable at the ingress of this infrastructure. Such contention might lead to unfairness, and poor per-customer latency and throughput guarantees, thus the SASE provider&#8217;s inability to honor any kind of network Service Level Objectives.   As a result, it is necessary to design some traffic policing scheme at the ingress of the system (i.e., at the tunnel termination point), that would perform traffic scheduling (i.e., delaying packets belonging to a flow to reduce its burstiness and impact on the downstream system&#8217;s buffers) and/or selective packet dropping, to ensure fairness among all tunnels.   While there are plenty of theoretical algorithms that ensure a high level of fairness between flows (for various definitions of fairness), those very often suffer from scalability issues due to the necessity of tracking the state of the different flows traversing the system. Moreover, even for algorithms whose scalability have been studied from a purely &#8220;computer-science&#8221; perspective (usually meaning asymptotic complexity for a large number of flows), such an approach is insufficient at the levels of throughput targeted by a high-performance software data plane.   In fact, properties such as cache-friendliness, or code vectorizability are more important when the per-packet CPU-budget for traffic policing is in the order of a hundred cycles. To the best of our knowledge, very little research has been done with this perspective in mind                      INTERNSHIP GOALS             This internship main general goal is to study traffic policing algorithms from the aforementioned perspective, in the context of SASE ingress. This can be carried out by means of:   &#8226;	A review of state-of-the-art traffic policing algorithms that ensure reasonable levels of fairness at a minimal complexity   &#8226;	Select among this list, those which have properties compatible with a high-performance packet-forwarding engine (review data structure cache locality for example)   &#8226;	Propose efficient implementations in a software dataplane (either the Linux Kernel, Click, or VPP)   &#8226;	Propose a quantitative theoretical and experimental analysis of those algorithms going beyond traditional asymptotical analysis   &#8226;	Release produced code in open source and theoretical and experimental results as an academical publication                       EXPECTED SKILLS                      C programming   Good understanding of core principles of packet switched networks and queuing networks   Ability to jump into a complex code base and hack into it   Ability to read and understand computer science/computer networking research papers   Academic English reading/writing skills                                                                     The Meraki cloud supports millions of customer devices from 10+data centres around the world.

We&#8217;re building an employee experience that includes appreciation, belonging, growth, and purpose for everyone.              Start date: April-June 2023  Duration: 6 months  Location: Hybrid, Paris office &amp; home office                        TEAM OVERVIEW            The intern will be part of the Cloud Native Data Plane (CNDP) team within the Security Business Group (SBG) at Cisco. This team contributes to many projects across SBG by developing, maintaining, and customizing the Vector Packet Processor (VPP), which is an open source piece of software part of the fd.io project. VPP is recognized as the most performant software-based packet forwarder available. This makes the CNDP team the ideal place to learn about high-performance data-plane programming.                       TOPIC OVERVIEW                       The Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) initiative consists of providing end-users with a combination of Software Defined WAN (SD-WAN) services and Network security services, all running in the cloud. In this context, SASE-providers must terminate a very large number of tunnels of various types (e.g., IPsec) in their own infrastructure. Unless the infrastructure is heavily overprovisioned with regards to the aggregated throughput of all the tunnels, Input/Output (I/O) and Central Processing Unit (CPU) resource contention is inevitable at the ingress of this infrastructure. Such contention might lead to unfairness, and poor per-customer latency and throughput guarantees, thus the SASE provider&#8217;s inability to honor any kind of network Service Level Objectives.   As a result, it is necessary to design some traffic policing scheme at the ingress of the system (i.e., at the tunnel termination point), that would perform traffic scheduling (i.e., delaying packets belonging to a flow to reduce its burstiness and impact on the downstream system&#8217;s buffers) and/or selective packet dropping, to ensure fairness among all tunnels.   While there are plenty of theoretical algorithms that ensure a high level of fairness between flows (for various definitions of fairness), those very often suffer from scalability issues due to the necessity of tracking the state of the different flows traversing the system. Moreover, even for algorithms whose scalability have been studied from a purely &#8220;computer-science&#8221; perspective (usually meaning asymptotic complexity for a large number of flows), such an approach is insufficient at the levels of throughput targeted by a high-performance software data plane.   In fact, properties such as cache-friendliness, or code vectorizability are more important when the per-packet CPU-budget for traffic policing is in the order of a hundred cycles. To the best of our knowledge, very little research has been done with this perspective in mind                      INTERNSHIP GOALS             This internship main general goal is to study traffic policing algorithms from the aforementioned perspective, in the context of SASE ingress. This can be carried out by means of:   &#8226;	A review of state-of-the-art traffic policing algorithms that ensure reasonable levels of fairness at a minimal complexity   &#8226;	Select among this list, those which have properties compatible with a high-performance packet-forwarding engine (review data structure cache locality for example)   &#8226;	Propose efficient implementations in a software dataplane (either the Linux Kernel, Click, or VPP)   &#8226;	Propose a quantitative theoretical and experimental analysis of those algorithms going beyond traditional asymptotical analysis   &#8226;	Release produced code in open source and theoretical and experimental results as an academical publication                       EXPECTED SKILLS                      C programming   Good understanding of core principles of packet switched networks and queuing networks   Ability to jump into a complex code base and hack into it   Ability to read and understand computer science/computer networking research papers   Academic English reading/writing skills                                                                     The Meraki cloud supports millions of customer devices from 10+data centres around the world.

We&#8217;re building an employee experience that includes appreciation, belonging, growth, and purpose for everyone.              Start date: April-June 2023  Duration: 6 months  Location: Hybrid, Paris office &amp; home office                        TEAM OVERVIEW            The intern will be part of the Cloud Native Data Plane (CNDP) team within the Security Business Group (SBG) at Cisco. This team contributes to many projects across SBG by developing, maintaining, and customizing the Vector Packet Processor (VPP), which is an open source piece of software part of the fd.io project. VPP is recognized as the most performant software-based packet forwarder available. This makes the CNDP team the ideal place to learn about high-performance data-plane programming.                       TOPIC OVERVIEW                       The Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) initiative consists of providing end-users with a combination of Software Defined WAN (SD-WAN) services and Network security services, all running in the cloud. In this context, SASE-providers must terminate a very large number of tunnels of various types (e.g., IPsec) in their own infrastructure. Unless the infrastructure is heavily overprovisioned with regards to the aggregated throughput of all the tunnels, Input/Output (I/O) and Central Processing Unit (CPU) resource contention is inevitable at the ingress of this infrastructure. Such contention might lead to unfairness, and poor per-customer latency and throughput guarantees, thus the SASE provider&#8217;s inability to honor any kind of network Service Level Objectives.   As a result, it is necessary to design some traffic policing scheme at the ingress of the system (i.e., at the tunnel termination point), that would perform traffic scheduling (i.e., delaying packets belonging to a flow to reduce its burstiness and impact on the downstream system&#8217;s buffers) and/or selective packet dropping, to ensure fairness among all tunnels.   While there are plenty of theoretical algorithms that ensure a high level of fairness between flows (for various definitions of fairness), those very often suffer from scalability issues due to the necessity of tracking the state of the different flows traversing the system. Moreover, even for algorithms whose scalability have been studied from a purely &#8220;computer-science&#8221; perspective (usually meaning asymptotic complexity for a large number of flows), such an approach is insufficient at the levels of throughput targeted by a high-performance software data plane.   In fact, properties such as cache-friendliness, or code vectorizability are more important when the per-packet CPU-budget for traffic policing is in the order of a hundred cycles. To the best of our knowledge, very little research has been done with this perspective in mind                      INTERNSHIP GOALS             This internship main general goal is to study traffic policing algorithms from the aforementioned perspective, in the context of SASE ingress. This can be carried out by means of:   &#8226;	A review of state-of-the-art traffic policing algorithms that ensure reasonable levels of fairness at a minimal complexity   &#8226;	Select among this list, those which have properties compatible with a high-performance packet-forwarding engine (review data structure cache locality for example)   &#8226;	Propose efficient implementations in a software dataplane (either the Linux Kernel, Click, or VPP)   &#8226;	Propose a quantitative theoretical and experimental analysis of those algorithms going beyond traditional asymptotical analysis   &#8226;	Release produced code in open source and theoretical and experimental results as an academical publication                       EXPECTED SKILLS                      C programming   Good understanding of core principles of packet switched networks and queuing networks   Ability to jump into a complex code base and hack into it   Ability to read and understand computer science/computer networking research papers   Academic English reading/writing skills                                                                     The Meraki cloud supports millions of customer devices from 10+data centres around the world.

Here&#8217;s how we do it.   We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&#8217;re ""old"" (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we&#8217;re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do - you can&#8217;t put us in a box!

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
