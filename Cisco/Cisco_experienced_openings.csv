Why Cisco    #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.  We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&#8217;re &#8220;old&#8221; (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we&#8217;re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do &#8211; you can&#8217;t put us in a box.  But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)  Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.  So, you have colorful hair? Don&#8217;t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That&#8217;s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

If reading this job ad makes you as excited as we are, then we should definitely connect!      Why Cisco    #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.  We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&#8217;re &#8220;old&#8221; (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we&#8217;re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do &#8211; you can&#8217;t put us in a box.  But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)  Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.  So, you have colorful hair?

We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do &#8211; you can&#8217;t put us in a box.  But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)  Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.  So, you have colorful hair? Don&#8217;t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That&#8217;s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

We are all unique, but collectively we bring our talents to work as a team, to develop innovative technology and power a more inclusive, digital future for everyone. How do we do it? Well, for starters &#8211; with people like you!    Nearly every internet connection around the world touches Cisco. We&#8217;re the Internet&#8217;s optimists. Our technology makes sure the data travelling at light speed across connections does so securely, yet it&#8217;s not what we make but what we make happen which marks us out. We&#8217;re helping those who work in the health service to connect with patients and each other; schools, colleges and universities to teach in even the most challenging of times. We&#8217;re helping businesses of all shapes and size to connect with their employees and customers in new ways, providing people with access to the digital skills they need and connecting the most remote parts of the world &#8211; whether through 5G, or otherwise.    We tackle whatever challenges come our way. We have each other&#8217;s backs, we recognise our accomplishments, and we grow together. We celebrate and support one another &#8211; from big and small things in life to big career moments. And giving back is in our DNA (we get 10 days off each year to do just that).    We know that powering an inclusive future starts with us. Because without diversity and a dedication to equality, there is no moving forward. Our 30 Inclusive Communities, that bring people together around commonalities or passions, are leading the way. Together we&#8217;re committed to learning, listening, caring for our communities, whilst supporting the most vulnerable with a collective effort to make this world a better place either with technology, or through our actions.

We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward. So, you have colorful hair?

Why Cisco    #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.  We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&#8217;re &#8220;old&#8221; (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we&#8217;re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do &#8211; you can&#8217;t put us in a box.  But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)  Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.  So, you have colorful hair?

Why Cisco    #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.  We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we&#8217;re &#8220;old&#8221; (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we&#8217;re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do &#8211; you can&#8217;t put us in a box.  But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)  Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.  So, you have colorful hair?

But &#8220;Digital Transformation&#8221; is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)  Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.  So, you have colorful hair? Don&#8217;t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That&#8217;s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!
